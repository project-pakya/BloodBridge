BloodBridge: Optimizing Lifesaving Resources using AWS services Scenario 1: Emergency Blood Request:

Sarah, a hospital administrator, logs into LifeLink during a critical situation. A patient needs a rare blood type urgently. Using her dashboard, Sarah quickly submits a high-priority blood request, specifying the required blood type and quantity. The system immediately notifies potential donors in the area, significantly reducing the time to find a match and potentially saving the patient's life.

Scenario 2: : Regular Donor Management

John, a regular blood donor, uses LifeLink to manage his donations. After logging in, he checks his dashboard to see when he's eligible to donate again. He notices a nearby blood drive event listed in the requests section. John uses the system to schedule his next donation, helping maintain a steady supply of blood for the local hospitals.

Scenario 3: Blood Bank Inventory Update:

A blood bank manager, Lisa, uses LifeLink to update the current blood inventory. She logs into her specialized account and accesses a feature to input the latest stock levels for each blood type. The system automatically updates the dashboard for all users, reflecting the current needs. This real-time update helps prioritize requests for blood types that are running low, ensuring efficient distribution of this vital resource.
